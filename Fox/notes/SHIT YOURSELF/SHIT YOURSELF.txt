How to use dorrs and hallways!!!!
{
	the doors and hallways are located in Objects/level_structure/level_structure
	 
	How doors work
	{
		You want to go to a door you placed in the level then doubleclick it and go to the creation code
		(this is how it should look like: https://ibb.co/5RLjRZ2)
		Then you wanna type targetRoom = room you want to go to
		(this is how it should look like: https://ibb.co/zHnqPpH)
		After you do that you want to place a door number that will link the doors(make sure a door number does not repeat twice)
		(this is how it should look like: the first room:https://ibb.co/5rFmndH and the second room: https://ibb.co/Jj78vxT)
		And done!!!
